Maestro Story Engine for Unity
====================

Maestro for Unity is a tool for creating highly visual electronic literature. It is best used for webcomics, motion comics, animated zines, and other multimedia literature.

Maestro extends the functionality of Unity by allowing one to create swipeable digital stories via a manual override of the engineâ€™s animation system. In addition, it contains commonly used boilerplate functionality, as well as the ability to create simple gameplay logic without needing to code.

Dependencies
====================

Currently, the following paid third party Unity plugin must be installed for Maestro to work:

[Sirenix Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/)

[DoTween Pro](https://dotween.demigiant.com/pro.php)

Other Maestro Versions
====================

Versions of Maestro currently exist for the game engines Unity and Cocos Creator, each less than ideal.

The Unity version relies on expensive, closed source code; in addition, Unity is a difficult system to learn for newcomers and nontechnical users.

The Cocos Creator version's authoring experience is likewise limited by a closed source editor.

Neither of these platforms performs optimally when expoorting electronic literature for the web.

For these reasons, a [third version of Maestro](https://github.com/artemiomorales/maestro-web) is currently being developed completely within the open source ecosystem using web technologies. The aim is to use this codebase as reference while developing that new version, which aspires to finally optimize Maestro's authoring experience for the open web.
